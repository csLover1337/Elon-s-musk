## Project Description
This is a small project with 6 contributors aiming to create an IQ Puzzler Pro Windows PC game using .NET framework and software engineering practices.
  
  IQ Puzzler Pro is a puzzle game consisting different puzzle pieces and a board. The goal of the game is to fit all puzzle pieces together onto the map. There will be different puzzle scenarios with varying difficulties. The game will include a timer, a hint box and a point system. Furthermore, there will be online version of the game where players able to create custom scenarios. They will be able to share them online for other players to compete for highscores.
  
  The solo part of the game will start with easy puzzles and the player will need to complete them to unlock harder ones. Easier levels will have less pieces to fit. The structure of the boards will vary, some will include already inserted pieces. The point system will start with a constant value and decrease as time passes or if hints are used.
  The online part will not include the puzzles in the solo part, instead it will only consist of custom made maps. Every map will have a score table and popularity. To make it fair, scores will be calculated by the time past since the first start of the puzzle (no option to pause). Custom maps will require completion from their creators for all online puzzles to be completable.
